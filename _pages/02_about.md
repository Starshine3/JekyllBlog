I'm Kate. Welcome to my personal website and translation blog.

I'm a rising 3rd year undergrad student at UC Berkeley, where I'm currently studying Computer Science and Economics.

I started learning Japanese back when I was a freshman in high school who loved Japanese music and video games. When I realized that a lot of songs that I liked did not have existing translations online, I decided to translate them myself. Thus my translation blog began~
