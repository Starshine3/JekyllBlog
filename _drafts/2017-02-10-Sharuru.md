It was you who said goodbye, yet tears are wet on your cheeks
If you're going to erase yesterday's memories in this way, I had enough, I laugh

Carrying a bouquet of flower, I walk without meaning, looking around in the town
This way I'm leaving behind my heart at the edge of my ideals, is this ok

I'm empty, when did this happen
How would it be if I fill myself with deep blue
Can I worry in this way?

I express my love above the clouds
But they became dirtied and ilegible
No, not the far away daily life that I imagined
