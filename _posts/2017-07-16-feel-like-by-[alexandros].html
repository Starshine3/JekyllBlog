    <div class="lyrics" id="engLyrics">I feel like singing without a word, without a word oh yeah
I feel like dancing without a step, without a step oh yeah
I know what's waiting outside the door oh yeah
I feel it's beating...
without a sound, without a sound oh yeah

I know you're waiting but you got to be moving
I feel it's beating without a sound, without a sound

I feel like dancing up all night
I'm gonna take you with me
It'd be alright

I feel like flying up in the sky
Just like a red, blue, green, yellow, silver kite

I feel like dancing up all night
I'm gonna take you with me
It'd be alright

I feel like flying up in the sky
Just like a red, blue, green, yellow, silver kite

I feel like singing without a word, without a word oh yeah
I feel like dancing without a step, without a step oh yeah
I know you're waiting but you got to be moving
I feel it's beating without a sound, without a sound

I feel like dancing up all night
I'm gonna take you with me
It'd be alright

I feel like flying up in the sky
Just like a red, blue, green, yellow, silver kite

I feel like dancing up all night
I'm gonna take you with me
It'd be alright

I feel like flying up in the sky
Just like a red, blue, green, yellow, silver kite

I feel like flying high above, above the sky
I feel like dancing without moving to the beat

I feel like flying high above, above the sky
I feel like singing without a word, the world is free to fly
