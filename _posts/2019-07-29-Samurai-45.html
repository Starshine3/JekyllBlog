We can go, we can go like a Samurai
We can go, we can go like a Samurai
いざ 参ろう いざ 参ろう like a 45
Oh oh oh oh
Do it like a Samurai

I’m on a mission
信じるは My decision
This is my moment Imma take it
一度しかないこの舞台 派手に散りたい

Listen
後に引けない Reason
It’s all or nothing, till I make it
逃げるくらいなら
I would die like a Samurai

We can go, we can go like a Samurai
We can go, we can go like a Samurai
いざ 参ろう いざ 参ろう like a 45
Oh oh oh oh
Do it like a Samurai

I have a vision
焦げるほどの Ambition
I scream it loud so you can hear me
もう揺らがない
This is do or die like a Samurai

We can go, we can go like a Samurai
We can go, we can go like a Samurai
いざ 参ろう いざ 参ろう like a 45
Oh oh oh oh

We can go, we can go like a Samurai
いざ 参ろう いざ 参ろう like a 45

This is my moment Imma take it
The only time on this stage, I want a glorious fall

I have a vision
The ambition that burns
I scream it loud so you can hear me
