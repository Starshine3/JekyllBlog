I've been ignoring everyone
I've been wandering around
I've been deceived everything. At that time.
Then you appeared in front of me
You ignited my pale heart
We've been looking for each other
From now on

Save you

際限ない犠牲を
朦朧とした理想を
もう無駄にしないようにと
悲しみを切り刻んだ

Get away from me
Get away from dark nightmare
Just now. Chip at your heart
We just fight for freedom
奪い合って　汚し合って
それでも守りたくて
I will share your fate

息をするたび肺にたまった
行き場のない苛立ち
いとも容易く踏みにじられる
憧憬の火は燃え続けてる

毅然とした本性で
まだまだ足掻くんだ

Get away from me
Get away from dark nightmare
Just now. Chip at my heart
I hold tight your freedom
凌ぎ合って　求め合って
拭えない憂いたちとあらがう

独りじゃない。と気づけた　僕の「昨日」も
傷だらけでも立ち上がった　君の「今日」も
生きたくても生きれなかった　誰かの「明日」も
二度と離さないように歩こう

際限ない犠牲を
朦朧とした理想を
もう無駄にしないようにと
悲しみを切り刻んだ

Get away from me
Get away from dark nightmare
Just now. Chip at your heart
We just fight for freedom
奪い合って　汚し合って
それでも守りたくて
Get away from me
Get away from dark nightmare
yeah
We don't want to go through that again
時は満ちた　始まりの鐘が鳴る
Yeah get away from me

Saigen nai gisei wo
Mourou to shita risou wo
Mou muda ni shinai you ni to
Kanashimi wo kirikizanda

Get away from me
Get away from dark nightmare

We just fight for freedom
Ubaiatte yogoshiatte
Sore demo mamoritakute
I will share your fate

Iki wo suru tabi hai ni tamatta
Yukiba no nai iradachi
Itomo tayasuku fuminijirareru
Shoukei no hi wa moetsuzuketeru

Kizen to shita honshou de
Madamada agakunda

Get away from me
Get away from dark nightmare
Just now. Chip at my heart

Shinogiatte motomeatte
Nuguenai urei tachi to aragau

Hitori janai to kizuketa boku no 'kinou’ mo
Kizu darake demo tachiagatta kimi no 'kyou’ mo
Ikitakute mo ikirenakatta dareka no 'asu’ mo
Nido to hanasanai youni arukou

Then you appeared in front of me
You ignited my pale heart
We've been looking for each other
From now on

Save you

Endless sacrifice
Hazy ideals
I will no longer let them go to waste
So I shredded my sadness

Get away from me
Get away from dark nightmare
Just now. Chip at your heart
We just fight for freedom
Fighting together, becoming tainted together
Even so I still want to protect you
I will share your fate

Collecting my lung as I breathe
Irritated at our lack of a refuge
It's extremely easy for us to be trampled on
The fire of our ambition continues to burn

Our true nature is firm
We still have yet to struggle

Get away from me
Get away from dark nightmare
Just now. Chip at my heart
I hold tight your freedom
Surviving together, praying together
Resisting the persisting sorrow

Yesterday I realized that I'm not alone
Today you rose up to fight even though you're covered with wounds
Tomorrow someone won't be able to live even though they want to continue living
Let's walk as if we never want to be separated again

Endless sacrifice
Hazy ideals
I will no longer let them go to waste
So I shredded my sadness

Get away from me
Get away from dark nightmare
Just now. Chip at your heart
We just fight for freedom
Fighting together, becoming tainted together
Even so I still want to protect you
Get away from me
Get away from dark nightmare
yeah
We don't want to go through that again
It's time, the rining bell signals the start
Yeah get away from me
