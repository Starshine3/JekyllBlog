都会の雑踏を
かき消すノイズ
耳ふさぐ　フードを
深くかぶる Choice
もう迷わない
もう迷わない
uh oh eh yo

People talk too much
But I just shut it up
俺には　関係ない
I can see you lie
It’s all black and white

So I close my eyes
Going off the edge
To the other side

Where’s
A way out, way out
To the other side
Diving deep into the night
羽広げ
Way out, way out
Leave it all behind

I’ll see you on the other side

I’ll see you on the other side
他に　道はない
俺には　これしかない
もう戻らない
On the other side

どいつもこいつも
自分のこと
あれもこれもそれも
欲しがるよ
欲望尽きない
欲望尽きない
もういいよ

Wanting way too much
Haven’t you had enough
気は済んだかい
吐きそうなくらい
溢れる　世界
So I close my eyes
Going off the edge
To the other side 

Where’s
A way out, way out
To the other side
Diving deep into the night
羽広げ
Way out, way out
Leave it all behind

I’ll see you on the other side

I’ll see you on the other side
他に　道はない
俺には　これしかない
もう戻らない
On the other side

I’ll see you on the other side
他に　道はない
俺には　これしかない
もう戻らない
On the other side

Where’s
A way out, way out
To the other side
Diving deep into the night
羽広げ
Way out, way out
Leave it all behind

I’ll see you on the other side

I’ll see you on the other side
他に　道はない
俺には　これしかない
もう戻らない
On the other side

I’ll see you on the other side
他に　道はない
俺には　これしかない
もう戻らない

Tokai no zattou wo
Kaki kesu noizu
Mimi fusagu fuudo wo
Fukaku kaburu Choice
Mou mayowanai
Mou mayowanai
uh oh eh yo

People talk too much
But I just shut it up
Ore ni wa kankei nai
I can see you lie
It’s all black and white

So I close my eyes
Going off the edge
To the other side

Where’s
A way out, way out
To the other side
Diving deep into the night
Hane hiroge
Way out, way out
Leave it all behind

I’ll see you on the other side

I’ll see you on the other side
Hoka ni michi wa nai
Ore ni wa kore shika nai
Mou modoranai
On the other side

Doitsu mo koitsu mo
Jibun no koto
Are mo kore mo sore more
Hoshigaru yo
Yokubou tsukinai

Mou ii yo

Wanting way too much
Haven’t you had enough
Ki wa sumunda kai
Tsuki souna kurai
Afureru sekai
So I close my eyes
Going off the edge
To the other side 

Where’s
A way out, way out
To the other side
Diving deep into the night

Noise erases the city's congestion
I pull my hood to block my ears by choice
I'm no longer lost
I'm no longer lost
uh oh eh yo

People talk too much
But I just shut it up
It doesn't have anything to do with me
I can see you lie
It’s all black and white

So I close my eyes
Going off the edge
To the other side

Where’s
A way out, way out
To the other side
Diving deep into the night
Spreading my wings
Way out, way out
Leave it all behind

I’ll see you on the other side

I’ll see you on the other side
There's no other road
There's only this for me
I can't turn back
On the other side

Everyone wants
This and this and that of me
Their desire is everlasting
Their desire is everlasting
It's fine

Wanting way too much
Haven’t you had enough
Aren't you done
On the verge of throwing up
Overflowing this world
So I close my eyes
Going off the edge
To the other side 

Where’s
A way out, way out
To the other side
Diving deep into the night
Spreading my wings
Way out, way out
Leave it all behind

I’ll see you on the other side

I’ll see you on the other side
There's no other road
There's only this for me
I can't turn back
On the other side

I’ll see you on the other side
There's no other road
There's only this for me
I can't turn back
On the other side

Where’s
A way out, way out
To the other side
Diving deep into the night
Spreading my wings
Way out, way out
Leave it all behind

I’ll see you on the other side

I’ll see you on the other side
There's no other road
There's only this for me
I can't turn back
On the other side

I’ll see you on the other side
There's no other road
There's only this for me
I can't turn back
On the other side
